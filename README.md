# CNN Image Classification Project

This project is a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification, built using TensorFlow and Keras. It demonstrates the complete process of creating, training, and evaluating a CNN model on the CIFAR-10 dataset.


## Overview
In this project, we implement a CNN for image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset. It covers model creation, training, evaluation, and comparison with pre-trained models.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch and Keras 
- Jupyter Notebook (optional)

## Dataset
We use the CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 60,000 color images in 10 different classes.
